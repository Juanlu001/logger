Simple logger package for Matlab, 
capable of writing to screen and file with several  options.

## Installation

Installation requires simply that you 
[download LOGGER](https://github.com/ep2/logger/archive/master.zip) 
and add the base directory 
(the one that contains the `+logger` directory) to your Matlab path.

### Dependencies

A recent version of Matlab is needed to run the code. 
The code has been developed in Matlab 2016a Academic version.  

### Testing

Unit tests are found in the `/test` subdirectory. After adding the package to
your Matlab path, you can run all tests by executing `runtests` from this 
subdirectory.
